\section{The Physics of Galaxy Pairs}
%What is a galaxy pair and how is it defined?
%What do we typically derive from a galaxy pair 
%are galaxy pairs a robust measure of things like merger rate?
%What systemeatics can we expect to fin in galaxy pairs (paper 3 plots 1,2,&3)

\section{Galaxy Morphologies Resulting from Galaxy Mergers}
%What is a galaxy merger and how is it defined?
%how do we estimate the rate of galaxy mergers?
%What happens during a galaxy merger?
%The fraction of elliptical galaxies stemming from galaxy major merger in steel

\section{Lenticular Galaxy Formation}
%What is a lenticular and why are they considered independently to the rest of the galaxy population?
%What have been the proposed models of Lenticular formation?
%Building a least assumption model of lenticular formation (supervised project)
