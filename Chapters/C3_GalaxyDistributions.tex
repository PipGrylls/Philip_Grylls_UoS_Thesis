\section{Background}
%What do we know about the distributions of galaxies
%Why important physics is encoded in galaxy distributions
%What is the current state of the art in galaxy distributions 
\section{Halo Structure and Dynamical Friction}
%as title
\section{Abundance Matching and Stellar Mass functions}
%show how stellar mass functions create different abundance matching results
\section{Multi-Epoch Distributions of Satellite Galaxies}
%Introduce the basic distribution plot with 'best fit' from the PhD
%Show the various impact of SMHM relationships, evolving vs non evolving e.t.c
%show stripping/SF routines and their effects:REMEMBER this is discussed elsewhere in detail dont write it twice.
%Show the dynamical friction model and how that actually impacts the distribution.
