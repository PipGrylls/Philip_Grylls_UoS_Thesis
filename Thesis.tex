This thesis describes the STastical sEmi-Empirical model, \steel, and it's contributions to the modelling of galaxies. \steel is built to overcome the limitations of volume and resolution; traditional models must choose between simulating large volumes or small details. Using a novel technique to replace discrete haloes with a statistical alternative using a combination of halo mass functions we remove these constraints and any associated biases. This cutting edge dark matter backbone is then combined with empirical techniques, e.g. Abundance Matching, to create $\steel$. In this thesis we describe five applications of $\steel$: Recreating the distributions of satellite galaxies over a cosmic time frame; Predicting the in-situ and ex-situ growth of central galaxies using constrained group and cluster environments; Calculating a new continuity style star formation rate; Understanding the systematic effects of the stellar-mass-halo-mass relation on the galaxy pair fraction; Testing proposed models for the evolution galaxy morphological fractions using constrained merger histories.

Using \steel we are able to build a picture of how populations of galaxies respond to modelling assumptions. Probing the in-situ vs. ex-situ growth we find that certain stellar mass functions are inconsistent with \LCDM hierarchical assembly. We find that the growth rate of massive galaxies is less than the predicted stellar mass accretion rate this creates an nonphysical system. \steel finds this result where others have missed it due to both it's statistical and empirical nature, this is a potential answer to why other models invoke large amounts of feedback to regulate galaxy growth when using these stellar mass functions. We find that cutting-edge stellar mass functions boasting enhanced number densities are self-consistent with \LCDM hierarchical assembly.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Charlotte Louise Grylls, my loving and supportive wife, without whom none of this would be possible.
    \item Jamie Francis Friel, my original co-author and best friend from day one. Your enthusiasm and friendly competition in science and mathematics have helped me endlessly.
    \item Helen Frances and John Grylls, my parents whom encouraged my science from my first breath and endured the tedious conversations that have yet to stop. I owe them both more than I can ever repay.
    \item Molley Scoble, Liam Jones, Rebecca Pembroke, and Kieran Neville, whom have kept me sane throughout my education. Also to all my friends not mentioned thank you for being there to share a pint and ignore me talking endlessly about science.
    \item My schools St. Louis Catholic School Frome and Prior Park College Bath and the excellent teachers who fostered environments that created a love of learning and an appreciation of academic excellence. Specifically Deirdre Cromie, a dedicated teacher who laid much of the foundation of my formal education and whom I distinctly remember arguing at length about triangles with, and Sarah Smith whom I regard as one of the greatest scientific influences in my life.
    \item UOB
    \item My friends and colleagues in the Southampton Astronomy Department, even if only Lorenzo Zanizi studies the correct objects! 
    \item Finally, Dr. Francesco Shankar, his passion for astronomy and this work has been outstanding throughout.
